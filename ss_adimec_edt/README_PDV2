-Run the EDTpdv_lnx_W.X.Y.Z.run file as sudo and when prompted  
 enter the desired location for the EDT files

-Do NOT try to install with the SCIP_SHELL_ENVIRONMENT active.

-Note that the EDT installer WON'T create its own folder, you  
 must specify the folder where the libs and executables will 
 live.

-Supplying home/opt/local will install all libs in local, instead  
 use 
		 /home/opt/local/EDTpdv

-To ease camera-link configuration, also install to the default 
 location of /opt/EDTpdv (note: /opt/* is root.root ownership
 except for /opt/EDTpdv (which has ownership eoslab.eoslab).


-Create a symlink to libtiff.so.5 inside EDTpdv/
-Have to search for this one,it does not come with EDT. 
-On the test OWL it's in /usr/lib/ 
                     (ln -s /usr/lib/libtiff.so.5 .)
-There may also be a copy in /home/eoslab/opt/local/lib

-Copy in the custom Adimec .cfg files into the 
               /home/eoslab/opt/local/EDTpdv/camera_config folder
-Currently they are called:
		adimec1600cd_10cl_bayer.cfg
		adimec1600cd_12cl_bayer.cfg
		adimec1600md_10cl_bayer.cfg

-Copy them to /opt/EDTpdv/camera-config (or camera_config?)

-Edit the EDTpdv makefile to add -fPIC to CFLAGS

Make sure that the above makefile uses the proper version of qmake (version>=4). 
If it insists on using qt3 qmake, modify $PATH so that qt4 qmake is picked up first 
(i.e. /usr/lib64/qt4/bin)


## Need these to build vlviewer/libpdv.so below
export PATH=/usr/lib64/qt4/bin:$PATH
export CFLAGS="-fPIC"

Remember -- do not build vlviewer or libpdv.so with the SCIP build environment enabled.


-Run sudo make vlviewer

-Run sudo make libpdv.so if libpdv.so has not already been
 created.

- Recursively change owner of the EDTpdv/ folder to eoslab.eoslab 
  (chown -R EDTpdv eoslab.eoslab)

-If permissions don't copy over recursively clone the 
 User permissions to group (chmod g=u -R EDTpdv)

-copy libpdv.so to ~/opt/SCIP-VIDEO-LIB1.2.4/lib/gstreamer-1.0/
-make sure LD_LIBRARY_PATH includes the directory containing
 libpdv.so. 

-For good measure, make sure that LD_LIBRARY_PATH
 also includes the EDTpdv installation directory.

Find liblibstedt.so and run ldd on it. Make sure that ldd
can find libpdv.so

cd to ~/.gstreamer-1.0 and remove the "blacklist" file, if any.
(the "blacklist" file will prevent gstreamer from loading the
 modules needed to stream video from the Camera Link framegrabber.

From the SCIP trunk (gst-xxx-camera-link directory), locate all the liblib*.so files
and copy them to /home/eoslab/opt/SCIP-VIDEO-LIB1.2.4/lib/gstreamer-1.0


- Recursively change owner of the EDTpdv/ folder to eoslab.eoslab (chown -R EDTpdv eoslab.eoslab)
-If permissions don't copy over recursively clone the User permissions to group	(chmod g=u -R EDTpdv)


Reminder: To run vlviewer, must set LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that it 
can pick up libdispatch.so in /home/eoslab/opt/local/EDTpdv

i.e. export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/eoslab/opt/local/EDTpdv:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Run vlviewer first as root, then use the Camera -> Camera Select 
to get the Adimec 1600C/D 10bit continuous setting (or something like that).

More vlviewer issues:

    Launch vlviewer, choose
      "1600C/D test 10-bit, camera continuous" item in the
      camera->select-camera dropdown menu. (Expand Adimec menu 
      node).  Corresponds to file adimec1600cd_10cl_bayer.cfg
      in /opt/EDTpdv/camera_config or 
      /home/eoslab/opt/local/EDTpdv/camera_config 

    vlviewer defaults to channel 0, cannot change the channel
    from within vlviewer.  If adimec is loaded into channel 0,
    and vlviewer is relaunched, it may crash.

    Run initcam as follows:

    CD to EDTpdv (in /opt or /home/eos/opt/local) and run
    as follows:

    ./initcam -f camera_config/adimec1600cd_10cl_bayer.cfg -c 1

    But this is not enough -- must clear adimec settings from 
    channel 0 by loading any non-adimec camera configuration, 
    i.e.  

   ./initcam -f \
    camera_config/any_non_adimec_camera.cfg -c 0
      

    Now should be able to relaunch vlviewer.

    Need to relaunch vlviewer specifying chan 1 to pick up
    adimec settings.

    ./vlviewer -c 1

scip_video.x (when run in the SCIP_SHELL_ENVIRONMENT environment) should now be 
able to use the edt interface.

Adimec (and swir) EosAdimecMain.x, EosSwirCamlinkMain.x need libpdv.so 

vlviewer needs libdispatch.so (created in ...opt/EDTpdv,
may need to copy it elsewhere).


EosAdimecMain.x frame-grabber operations ripped straight from
EDTpdv sample code file serial_command.c (pretty much copy/paste
into EosAdimecMain.x)



EDTpdv executables may crash randomly if the camera is not connected 
to the frame grabber.
