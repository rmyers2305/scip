	The Adimec can be controlled directly through EDT's vlviewer application. At the time
of this writing vlviewer is located in `/opt/local/EDTpdv. Vlviewer needs to be run as sudo.
Once you run vlviewer it will ask for camera config file. There are currently three config 
files written for our Adimec 1600 c/d, adimec1600cd_10cl_bayer.cfg, 
adimec1600md_10cl_bayer.cfg, and adimec1600cd_12cl_bayer.cfg. Use either the cd_10cl_bayer
or the md_10cl_bayer config files. They set the camera to use a 10bit output resolution. 
The cd_12_bayer file will set the camera to use a 12 bit output resolution but I can't get
the adimec to perform correctly when set to 12 bit.

	The EDT Framegrabber has two channels that allows for the simulaneous operation
of two digital cameras. However each channel needs to be initalized before it can be
used. As far as I can tell the easiest way to achieve this is to build and run EDT's
supplied initcam.c program and pass to it the config file for the camera that will be 
used as well as the channel number that the camera will be used on.
	Often the initcam.c file will be built during the same build process that makes
EDT's vlviewer program. If either the build process fails to make initcam or vlviewer is
not being built initcam can be built seperately by simply navigating to the EDTpdv 
folder and running ' make initcam '(without the apostrophes). Depending on library 
ownership and permissions this may need to be run as sudo.
	Once initcam is built navigate to ss_adimec/scripts/EDT and run the 
pdv_init.sh script. This script is currently set to initialize both channels and 
configure them to run the adimec1600c/d. If the script fails to properly execute or 
different camera config files need to be supplied the channels can be configured 
manually.
	If needed navigate to the EDTpdv/ folder then execute 
' ./initcam -f <path/to/config/file> -c <channel number (0 or 1)> ' 
This should properly configure the supplied channel to operate with the desired camera.
If two cameras are to be installed rerun the command and then specify the other channel.

  

For owl-01-02.sd.spawar.navy.mil, do the following:

cd /opt/EDTPdv
./initcam -f camera_config/adimec1600cd_10cl_bayer.cfg -c 0
         or 
./initcam -u 0 -f camera_config/adimec1600cd_10cl_bayer.cfg  

./vlviewer
